about=This plugin retrieves all codes and labels from columns with ValueMap widget and compiles a table layer added to the QGIS project.
	The table layer has four text columns named: fieldname, cod, label and layer and it is automatically created and added to the QGIS project.
	This table is then used by the valueMap_in_attributeTable.js file in order to show descriptions instead of lables in Lizmap attribute tables.
	The resulting table layer must be added to lizmap web client as WFS layer.
	Moreover the script automatically put the valueMap_in_attributeTable.js in the proper folder i.e. media/js/project_name/.
	If these folders do not exist, they are automatically created.
	The valueMap_in_attributeTable.js only works for fields of type text with Lizmap 3.3. Numerical fields will be supported starting from Lizmap 3.4.
