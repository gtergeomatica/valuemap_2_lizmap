about=This plugin retrieves all codes and labels from columns with ValueMap widget and compiles a table layer added to the QGIS project.
	The table layer has three text columns named: fieldname, cod and label and it is automatically created and added to the QGIS project.
	This table is then used by the valueMap_in_attributeTable.js file in order to show descriptions instead of lables in Lizmap attribute tables.
	The resulting table layer must be added to lizmap web client.
	This python script also creates a txt file with the list of layers names with ValueMap widgets.
	This list can be used to add the layers name to the valueMap_in_attributeTable.js file.
	Moreover the script automatically put the valueMap_in_attributeTable.js in the proper folder i.e. media/js/project_name/.
	If these foldere do not exist, they are automatically created.
